# Plural CLI

Deploying your services using the Plural CLI.

## Installation

The Plural CLI is available on homebrew, a single line install can be done with:

```bash
brew install pluralsh/plural/plural
```

If you are using a machine that is not compatible with homebrew,
we recommend simply downloading a pre-built release on github and installing it onto your machines path. The releases can be found here: https://github.com/pluralsh/plural-cli/releases.

## Requirements

Plural does require a few other CLI's to be installed, namely:
* `helm`
* `terraform`
* `kubectl`
* cloud provider CLI for the infrastructure you're deploying to, like `aws`, `az`, `gcloud` etc.

## Quickstart

Detailed instructions can be found at https://docs.plural.sh/deployments/cli-quickstart.
